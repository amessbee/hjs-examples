# JavaScript Compartments: A Comprehensive Guide

In recent years, JavaScript has evolved significantly, with new features and paradigms emerging to improve security and modularity in web development. One such innovation is the concept of compartments. Compartments are a concept in Hardened JavaScript which is a standards track mode for the JavaScript language for safe plugin systems and supply chain attack resistance. Hardening JavaScript improves a programâ€™s integrity in the face of adversarial code in the same process. This article aims to explore JavaScript compartments, their importance, various options available, and how to use them effectively with detailed code examples.

## What are JavaScript Compartments?

Compartments in JavaScript are a concept introduced to create isolated environments for executing code. They help in encapsulating code, ensuring that the execution environment is secure and does not interfere with the global state. This isolation is crucial in scenarios where you want to run untrusted code, avoid global namespace pollution, or create secure sandboxed environments.
